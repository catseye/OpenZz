This is a fork of the original OpenZz distribution.  The original README
follows after the first line of equals signs in this file.

This fork was made because development on OpenZz was stalled, I have a
project which requires it ( http://catseye.tc/node/Zzrk.html ), and I
needed to make changes to the sources to get them to build on the latest
version of gcc.

Shortly thereafter, upgrades to (apparently) libtool(?) caused automake
to generate Makefiles which went into infinite loops at the shell level
(`pstree` showed what looked like an infinite tree of `sed` and `bash`)
which would take down my laptop quite readily.

So, I added a simple script `build.sh` to build the `ozz` executable
directly, without messing around with libraries or anything.  It works
on Ubuntu, and will (I'm sure) work on other flavours of Linux with only
minor modifications.

Running `build.sh` is recommended.  Run `autogen.sh` and `configure` at
your own risk.

                 Zz - Dynamic Lexical Parser README File
===============================================================================

Zz is a dynamic parser which is currently being developed as a front end to
gcc to implement compilation of new languages (ie. TAO and others), for APE
systems.  These are custom build parallel processing computers used for LQCD
physics research.
